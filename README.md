* ### The Good.
The followed a bloc-architecture pattern.

All the display logic / filter logic is in the bloc.

Maximum widgets are stateless -> Widgets change when data in the bloc changes not by managing their own states. 

* ### The Bad.
Ideally, filtering should be done through local database or api call.

* ### The Ugly.
UI polishing.
